Glimpse.ClaimsInspector (WIF fork)
=======================

This is a tweak of Chris' ClaimsInspector to expose WIF claims in System.IdentityModel rather than the 3.5 Microsoft.IdentityModel. I'm using this with Azure AD Authentication. 

Exposes System.IdentityModel.Claims in Glimpse.  This can be used to display WIF claims client side through Glimpse, including Azure AD and Azure ACS claims.
